# Testing
I have tested the page continuously as i built it. This vill be noticable as we go through some bugs since the colors will be diffrent from the finished product. I will show screenshots and explenations of some of the bugs i encountered during this progress. 

## Bugs

- **Bug 1**
  - I didn't get the logo in the header and the navigation bar to get on the same row in the header. 

![image of the first bug where the navigation bar and logo in the header appeared on two rows](docs/bug1.JPG) 

- **Fix for bug 1**
  - Added flot left property to the logo in the header. Which made the navigation bar to pop up on the same row with its float right element. 

![image of the fix for the first bug](docs/bug1-fix.JPG) 

- **Bug 2**
  - Had a problem where all the left elements didn't appear on the left and some stacked on the right side. As you can see on the colors. The blue should all be on the left and the red should all be on the right. 

![image of the second bug where the elements didn't align](docs/bug2.JPG) 

- **Fix for bug 2**
  - The height difference where to problem which made the blue go over on the right side. 
  - Fixed it by setting the same height to the elements.

![image of the fix for the second bug](docs/bug2-fix.JPG) 

- **Bug 3**
  - The navigation bar wasn't responsive on smaller screens. Didnt look good and only made a new row.

![image of the third bug where navigation bar wasn't responsive on samller screens](docs/bug3.JPG) 

- **Fix for bug 3**
  - Added float left poperty to the navigation bar for screen sizes of 850px and down.
  - Reduced the font size to make it fit under the logo in the header.

![image of the fix for the third bug](docs/bug3-fix.JPG) 

- **Bug 4**
  - The footer didn't stick to the bottom of the screen when it was to little content to push it down.

![image of the fourth bug where the footer didn't stick to the bottom of the screen](docs/bug4.JPG) 

- **Fix for bug 4**
  - Fixed with flexbox, i got the code from [Kiran Workspace](https://kiranworkspace.com/how-to-stick-footer-to-bottom-of-page/)
  - Added a class to the content div and added code in style.css from Kiran.

## Responsiveness
- **This was tested manually with Dev tools to look at the content from diffrent sizes. From which i choosed some breaking points to add media queries to make sure the content look good on all devices.**
  - 1300px wide and down: From where the introduction first encountered problems. Solved it by moving the image down under the text content. 
  - 850px wide and down: From this size and down all the pages started to get problems with overflow. So from here and down all content is stacked vertically instead of horizontally. 
  - 550px wide and down: The footer colappsed and didnt work at all. So i increased the height of the footer and stacked the link to the newsletter form and social links on top of eachother. 
  - 425px wide and down: Reduced som font sizes to make it look better on smaller screens.
