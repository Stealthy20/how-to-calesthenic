# How To Calisthenic
How To Calisthenic is a website dedicated to folks who are interested in learning more about calisthenics and getting started with it. There are countless videos available, the majority of which highlight the sport's difficult and glamorous aspects. I wanted to acquire the basics for a beginning, as well as some solid people to follow in the community. So that theyÂ will have the best chance of being successful with calisthenics.

- **Inspiration**
  - This page is a very important page for me. There are thousands of different  people that claims that they know what they are talking about. I have listed three really good and inspirational people for beginners to follow.

## Upcoming features

# Testing
I have tested the page continuously as I built it. This will be noticeable as we go through some bugs since the colors will be different from the finished product. I will show screenshots and an explanation of some of the bugs i encountered during this progress. 

## Bugs

- **Bug 1**
  - I didn't get the logo in the header and the navigation bar to get on the same row in the header. 

![Image of the first bug where the navigation bar and logo in the header appeared on two rows](docs/bug1.JPG) 

- **Fix for bug 1**
  - Added float left property to the logo in the header. Which made the navigation bar to pop up on the same row with its float right element. 

![Image of the fix for the first bug](docs/bug1-fix.JPG) 

- **Bug 2**
  - Had a problem where all the left elements didn't appear on the left and some were stacked on the right side. As you can see from the colors. The blue should all be on the left and the red should all be on the right. 

![Image of the second bug where the elements didn't align](docs/bug2.JPG) 

- **Fix for bug 2**
  - The height difference were the problem which made the blue go over on the right side. 
  - Fixed it by setting the same height to both the elements.

![Image of the fix for the second bug](docs/bug2-fix.JPG) 

- **Bug 3**
  - The navigation bar wasn't responsive on smaller screens. It made a new row and stayed on the right. Which wasn't looking good.

![Image of the third bug where navigation bar wasn't responsive on smaller screens](docs/bug3.JPG) 

- **Fix for bug 3**
  - Added float left property to the navigation bar for screen sizes of 850px and down.
  - Reduced the font size to make it fit under the logo in the header.

![Image of the fix for the third bug](docs/bug3-fix.JPG) 

- **Bug 4**
  - The footer didn't stick to the bottom of the screen when it was too little content to push it down.

![Image of the fourth bug where the footer didn't stick to the bottom of the screen](docs/bug4.JPG) 

- **Fix for bug 4**
  - Fixed with flexbox, i got the code from [Kiran Workspace](https://kiranworkspace.com/how-to-stick-footer-to-bottom-of-page/)
  - Added a class to the content div and added code in style.css from Kiran.

## Responsiveness
- **This was tested manually with Dev tools to look at the content from different sizes. From which i choose some breaking points to add media queries to make sure the content looks good on all devices.**
  - 1300px wide and down: From where the introduction first encountered problems. Solved it by moving the image down under the text content. 
  - 850px wide and down: From this size and down, all the pages started to get problems with overflow. So from here and down all content is stacked vertically instead of horizontally. 
  - 550px wide and down: The footer collapsed and didn't work at all. So i increased the height of the footer and stacked the link to the newsletter form and social links on top of each other. 
  - 425px wide and down: Reduced some font sizes to make it look better on smaller screens.
