                <h2>What Is Calisthenic</h2>
                <p>
                    Calisthenics is a type of training in which you primarily use your body weight to target large-muscle-group exercises.
                    It's also known as a street workout since it can be done outside with little to no equipment. Calisthenics are strongly associated to cool exercises like muscle ups or the human flag.
                    However, there are several beginner-friendly routines to help you get started in the sport. This is what we will focus on here.

                <h2>How To Get Started</h2>
                <p>
                    Before going out, attempting the challenging exercise only to discover that this is too difficult for you. So, first and foremost, 
                    you must determine your current level. So that you can begin at a level that is appropriate for you.
                    For further information, go to the "Get Started" page. Make a plan to continue to strengthen yourself at the current level.
                     Then you're prepared to start your journey with the easier variations and work your way up to the more difficult ones.

                <h2>Basics Of Calisthenic</h2>
                <p>
                    Mastering the fundamentals is a fantastic place to start before moving on to the more difficult varieties.
                    So, what is the fundamental?
                    Everything else, in my opinion, stems from these four activities. Push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, and squats are the exercises.
                    The beauty of this sport is that almost everyone is aware of these workouts. All you need is a spot to do pull-ups to get started.

                <h2>Where To Train</h2>
                <p>
                    So now we know what to do and where to begin. But where are we going to train?
                    If you have a pull-up bar at home, this is a great place to start.
                    If that's not an option, look for an outdoor gym or perhaps a calisthenic park.
                    If neither of these are available where you live, look for a children's playground. You can generally find a spot to do pull-ups here.
